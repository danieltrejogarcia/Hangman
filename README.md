both a single player mode and a 2 player mode
simple ascii graphics displaying your progress

How to play:
1.Run python hangman.py
2.Select the difficulty
3.Choose the number of players. If 2 player mode is selected chose secret word
4.Guess letters in the secret word one at a time
5.The game is over when either the word is solved or there are no more guesses left
