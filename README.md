# Hangman
This is a console based Hangman game I created as a refresher of python knowledge.

**Features:**<br>
3 different difficulties for the game
both a single player mode and a 2 player mode
simple ascii graphics displaying your progress

**How to play:<br>**
1.Run python hangman.py<br>
2.Select the difficulty<br>
3.Choose the number of players. If 2 player mode is selected chose secret word<br>
4.Guess letters in the secret word one at a time<br>
5.The game is over when either the word is solved or there are no more guesses left
